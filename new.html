		What an exciting time it is for Sixth College! This is the year of our twentieth anniversary and what better place to celebrate than our still brand-new home at the North Torrey Pines Living Learning Neighborhood. Our neighborhood waits for you to exploit its myriad opportunities and bring it to its full glory. I look forward to a journey of discovery and growth for each of us and to the opportunity we will have to put our stamp on our college and our permanent home. There is freedom in being the earliest adventurers to explore an environment that promotes innovation and I invite you to stretch your imagination and help shape Sixth’s future. I am excited to welcome our new Sixers and our wonderful returnees. I know YOU will raise the bar in ways we can only dream of. Sixth is all about community—first, foremost, and always.Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt utlabore et dolore magna aliqua.
